FacebookAutoScriptsJS
- Gaurav Ragtah

These are some scripts for facebook. Ideas for others are appreciated.
Currently, I have:
1. a script for liking all wall posts on a profile (slightly buggy, doesn't expand older posts all the way down/like some of those posts; maybe this won't be a problem with facebook timeline? needs to be worked on)
2. a script for auto-wishing everyone with a birthday today (of course, taking advantage of the new popup birthday wish interface that fb added)
  

NOTE: Facebook gave me warning for using the like-all script consecutively a few times, so don't overuse it.
What happens is not my responsibility.
